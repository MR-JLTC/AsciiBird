## Objective

The objective of this project was to develop a game using MASM assembly and the [Irvine 32-bit Library](http://www.asmirvine.com/gettingStartedVS2019/index.htm) (Note: This link also contains a guide on how to setup Visual Studio 2019 for developing, assembling, and debugging MASM assembly). It was completed as a part of my coursework for my undergraduate degree.

Built with MASM assembly and Visual Studio 2019 in 2023.

## Use

This project is not intended to be used as a template or guide, but it can definitely can be used as "inspiration." Please link back to this repo or [MalakaiSpann.com](https://malakaispann.com) if you do.

### How to Play

Simply download the `AsciiBird.exe` file on a Windows machine and run.

Windows should generate some form of security error (which is good; just doing its job) because the file has no signatures or any of the info necessary to verify it as a non-malicious application. 

While the file is safe (read through or assemble the source code yourself and compare), it is still your responsibility to use your better judgement and ensure anything you download from the internet is safe.

## Inspirations

While making the site, I looked to these videos for some game function ideas:

- [TermSpar's Basic 2D Platformer Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCkvtRDo_GQ&list=PLeRe7Vcdenjjm6j_tQsO9HSDEN6KFC-vy&index=1&t=1687s&ab_channel=TermSpar)
- [Pirxie's Flappy Bird Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSH_v4WhRZI&list=PLeRe7Vcdenjjm6j_tQsO9HSDEN6KFC-vy&index=2&ab_channel=Pirxie)

Go checkout these talented devs!

Friendly reminder: don't be a weirdo who steals source code. Even when credited, it's still pretty shady to straight copy someone else's work. The occasional peak when you're stuck is fine, but learn how to do it yourself... it'll get you much farther!
